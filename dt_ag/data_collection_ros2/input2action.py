    """
    Converts an input from an active device into a valid action sequence that can be fed into an env.step() call

    If a reset is triggered from the device, immediately returns None. Else, returns the appropriate action

    Args:
        device (Device): A device from which user inputs can be converted into actions. Can be either a Spacemouse or
            Keyboard device class

        robot (Robot): Which robot we're controlling

        active_arm (str): Only applicable for multi-armed setups (e.g.: multi-arm environments or bimanual robots).
            Allows inputs to be converted correctly if the control type (e.g.: IK) is dependent on arm choice.
            Choices are {right, left}

        env_configuration (str or None): Only applicable for multi-armed environments. Allows inputs to be converted
            correctly if the control type (e.g.: IK) is dependent on the environment setup. Options are:
            {bimanual, single-arm-parallel, single-arm-opposed}

    Returns:
        2-tuple:

            - (None or np.array): Action interpreted from @device including any gripper action(s). None if we get a
                reset signal from the device
            - (None or int): 1 if desired close, -1 if desired open gripper state. None if get a reset signal from the
                device
